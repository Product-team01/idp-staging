## Taxonomy

<ol>
  <li>A taxonomy is a hierarchical structure used to tag data with attributes.</li>
  <li>The taxonomy offers a structured and organized approach to categorizing data, from the main categories down to specific subcategories. For example, "color" is an attribute, and the actual colors like "red," "blue," etc., are the possible values for that attribute.</li>
  <li>By clicking on the 'View Taxonomy' button, you can access the complete taxonomy in a full-screen, read-only mode. In this mode, you can navigate through different levels of the taxonomy to explore various attribute-values. However, no other actions will be available during this viewing mode.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only if ‘Enrich’ is subscribed, the Enrich card will be available. Only if the tags are generated, the the taxonomy card will be available.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Feeds:</strong> Use ‘Feeds’ to filter and view only the content within each feed. By default, the content is displayed for All Feeds combined together.</li>
  <li><strong>Search:</strong> Search for particular content. Note: Search is enabled for all fields mapped as searchable during the catalog creation process.</li>
  <li><strong>Filter:</strong> Use filters on the left panel to find content. Note: All fields mapped as facet during the catalog creation process are available as filters.</li>

</ol>

<div className="image-container">
  <img src="https://d1r1e7xjkfj7nz.cloudfront.net/explore5bb.png" alt="Grid View" title="Grid View" />
</div>

### Bulk Content Actions

<p>Click on more than one content checkbox or ‘Select All’ CTA to edit/approve the predicted tags for the content in bulk:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All the common predicted tags for the selected content are displayed for you to review.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Note: If there are any conflicting tag values for the same attribute are present, then an information prompt for conflicting values is displayed</li>
    </ol>
  <li>You can select only the tag/attribute you wish to approve and click on ‘Approve All Tags’ CTA</li>
  <li>You can edit and change the value of any tag, by either (i) hovering over the tag and click on ‘Edit’ icon, or (ii) click on the ‘Edit Tags'.</li>
  <li>Clicking on the ‘Deselect’ CTA deselects the selected content.</li>
</ol>

<div className="image-container">
  <img src="https://d1r1e7xjkfj7nz.cloudfront.net/explore6bb.png" alt="Bulk Content Actions" title="Bulk Content Actions" />
</div>

### Conflicting Values

<ol>
  <li>When more than one content is selected, there can be different values for the same attributes for the contents selected. Those are called conflicting values.</li>
  <li>The user cannot approve conflicting values. The user can edit and change the value to be common for all contents selected. Then it can be approved.</li>
  <li><strong>'Edit Tags' CTA:</strong> When clicked, it displays the entire taxonomy hierarchy, allowing the user to edit any attribute value.</li>
  <li><strong>‘Approve All Tags’ CTA:</strong> When clicked, it approves all attributes in the panel.</li>
  <li>If the user approves empty/null values, then it will be considered as user edited.</li>
  <li>Once 'Approve All Tags' is clicked, the ‘Updating’ label will be displayed on the item(s) and the message “Changes will be reflected in a while” will be shown in the panel.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the below example, multiple products are selected and tags are generated for all the products on the Tags panel. Since all the tags for all the products have different values, there are conflicting values. The user cannot approve them. The tags can be edited using ‘Edit Tags’ CTA or hovering on the tag’s row and clicking on ‘Edit’ icon. Now once they have common values, they will not have conflicting values.</p>

<p>The Tags can then be approved by selecting all the corresponding checkboxes and clicking on the ‘Approve All Tags’ CTA.</p>

<div className="image-container">
  <img src="https://d1r1e7xjkfj7nz.cloudfront.net/explore7bb.png" alt="Conflicting Values Example" title="Conflicting Values Example" />
</div>

<p>In the below example, the attributes "Base Color," "Type," and "Color" for the Bags product have conflicting values and will not be approved. Once the user edits and changes the values of these attributes to be common for all selected products, the Tags can be approved by selecting all the checkboxes and clicking on the 'Approve All Tags' CTA.</p>

<div className="image-container">
  <img src="https://d1r1e7xjkfj7nz.cloudfront.net/explore8bb.png" alt="Conflicting Values Resolution" title="Conflicting Values Resolution" />
</div>

### Single Content View

<ol>
  <li>Single content will be shown in the screen. The user can zoom in or zoom out using the respective icons to view the content.</li>
  <li><strong>Carousel:</strong> Ten contents will be shown. The user can click on any content to see it. On clicking the next or previous icons in the carousel, ten more contents will be shown to select.</li>
</ol>

### Single Content Actions

<p>Click on content or ‘Edit’ within the More Actions menu on each card to view or edit metadata and/or the predicted tags for each individual content</p>

</div>

<ol>
  <li>Within the ‘Tags’ tab, you can view the predicted values and their confidence scores.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>If you wish to edit the predictions, click on the dropdown of the tag/attribute you wish to edit and select the desired value.</li>
      <li><strong>‘Edit Tags' CTA:</strong> You can also edit tags by clicking on 'Edit Tags’ CTA</li>
      <li>If you want to approve the predicted tags, click on the checkbox of the tags that you want to approve and click on ‘Approve All Tags’ CTA</li>
    </ol>
</ol>

<p>In the below example, tags are generated for the bag along with confidence scores displayed in the Tags panel. The user has the option to approve or edit the values. The tags can be edited by using the 'Edit Tags' CTA or by hovering over the tag's row and clicking on the 'Edit' icon.</p>

</ol>

<p>In the below example, the metadata and tags can be edited both in the table and in the side panel. The panel operation is similar to bulk content actions and in the table, click on the cell of the metadata that you want to edit and edit the content.</p>

<p>For Tags, click on the tags cell dropdown and edit the values that you want to edit. Select the values, if you want to clear the selected checkboxes, click on ‘Reset’ button. Click on ‘Apply’ button to apply the changes.</p>

## Filters

<p>You can filter the content by using the metadata and taxonomy filters separately. Here are the details on how to use these filters:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Metadata filter:</strong> This filter allows you to select a combination of values from different fields and apply the filter. The result of items shown should be based on the combination of values, and all values should match.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reset CTA:</strong> Clears all the filters that are chosen</li>
      <li><strong>Apply CTA:</strong> Applies the chosen filters</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Tags filter:</strong> This filter allows you to select a combination of values from different fields and apply the filter. The result of items shown should be based on the combination of values, and all values should match. The filter options and values of Taxonomy are based on the tags predicted for the catalog items. Additionally, there is a status filter available, which includes Reviewed, Unreviewed, Partially Reviewed, No Predictions, Updating</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reset CTA:</strong> Clears all the filters that are chosen</li>
      <li><strong>Apply CTA:</strong> Applies the chosen filters</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot combine filter options from metadata and taxonomy together. If you try to filter either using metadata or taxonomy after already applying a filter or selecting filter options, then the filter already applied or selected will be reset and replaced with the new/latest filter selection.</p>

## Content cards

<p>The content card consists of:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Content image:</strong> The image of the content.</li>
  <li><strong>Content status:</strong> This label indicates the status of the Content in terms of its metadata and tags. The labels are as follows:</li>

      <li><strong>Reviewed:</strong> This label indicates that all tags for the item have been approved or edited.</li>
      <li><strong>Unreviewed:</strong> This label indicates that all predictions for the item are still in the system generated state.</li>
      <li><strong>Partially Reviewed:</strong> This label indicates that there are more than one prediction for a content and at least one of the predictions is still system-generated, and/or at least one tag has no predicted value.</li>
      <li><strong>No Predictions:</strong> This label indicates that the content has no system-generated predictions.</li>
      <li><strong>Updating:</strong> This label indicates that changes to metadata, tags, are being synced with the back-end system. In this state, you cannot make further edits to the values until the update is complete for that item.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Metadata fields:</strong> The metadata fields describe the content.</li>
</ol>

## Metadata Panel

<ol>
  <li><strong>Panel Expansion:</strong> The user can expand or collapse the panel to access metadata, tags, for the selected items.</li>
  <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> This section displays all the indexed fields for the selected items. The user can edit any field by clicking on it and updating the value. The panel will display the following CTAs:</li>
