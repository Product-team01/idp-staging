      <h3>Visualization and Reporting</h3>
      <p>
        The Vue Platform provides visualization capabilities for you to be able to create charts and reports that can be used for storytelling within the platform, and for export.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fundamental building blocks of all reports are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Charts:</strong> All chart-based visualizations like pie charts, area charts, line charts, bar graphs etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Cards:</strong> Information cards that can be used to show metrics</li>
        <li><strong>Tables:</strong> Data and pivot tables</li>
        <li><strong>Controls:</strong> Filters that can be applied to the entire report</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Overall Reporting Options</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Layout:</strong> This can be changed as it pleases the user. Currently 2x2 and 3x3 grid views are offered as options</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> The entire report can be exported as a pdf and downloaded</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> The report can be run on the entire data/ a pre-created sample/ new sample</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Auto-generation</h3>
      <p>
        Reports can also be auto-generated by selecting the New Report â†’ Generate Reports option. This uses Generative AI that takes into account the sample data and schema to generate multiple charts that serve as a starting point from where users can edit / create new visualization and/or entire reports.
