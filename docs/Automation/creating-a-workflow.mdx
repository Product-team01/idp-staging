### Building a Workflow:
- **Add Nodes**:
  - Nodes can be added to the workflow in two ways:
    - Add a node by hovering over the Nodes section, searching for the needed Node, and finally dragging & dropping it into the Workflow Canvas.
    - Right-click on the Workflow Canvas and search for the required node to add it. This also shows the history of recent nodes used.

- **Link Nodes**:
  - After adding the required nodes, they can be linked by dragging the end of one node and connecting it to the start of another node.
