In this article, we will explore the different ways you will be able to annotate attributes on your documents. An annotation is supplementary information describing the position of each attribute on the document. We will walk through how to annotate key-value attributes with a simple bounding box and table attributes where you will be able to define rows and columns to extract information at a cell level.

## Attribute Annotations

- To create a new attribute annotation, click the ‘Add new’ button on the taxonomy tab or use the ‘annotation’ tool on the toolbar.

- To draw an annotation, select the annotation tool and draw a box on the document preview to indicate where the attribute value can be found on the document. 

You can then select the Type of attribute to further 
- Once you have drawn your annotation, you will be able to view the annotation crop preview on the right-side panel. 
    - To view an enlarged image of the same, hover over the crop.
    - To delete and redraw the annotation, click the delete icon on the crop and redraw the bounding box as needed.define the extraction conditions. These are the available data types:

### Data types:

### Free form text

- When selected, any and all form of extractions will be extracted from the bounding box selected area.

### Barcode

- When selected, the barcode will be cropped as the extraction from the bounding box selected area.

### Date

- When selected, you will be able to define the output format of the extracted date. 
- Example: Converting and standardizing all dates to the format ‘DD-MM-YYYY’.

### Name

- When selected, you will be able to define the output format of the extracted name. 
- Example: Converting and standardizing all names to follow the format ‘Last Name, First Name’.

### Numeric

- When selected, you will be able to define the output format of the extracted number. 
- Example: Converting and standardizing all numeric extractions of this attribute to follow the format of ‘Decimal rounded to 3 digits’.

### Alphanumeric

- When selected, you will be able to define the number of characters expected in this attribute extraction.
- Example: ID numbers of a standardized 10 characters.

## Table Annotations

- To add a table attribute, click the ‘Table Annotation’ button on the toolbar or select ‘Table’ as the attribute Data type.

- Once you have save your new attribute, you will be able to view it’s exacted value on the Page Extraction tab where you can validate or edit as needed

- To draw the annotation, draw a box around the boundary of the table and define the number of rows and columns.

- Adjust the grid lines by dragging the lines to align with your table as needed to indicate the boundaries of the extractions at a cell level.

- If you would like to extract the first row as the header of your table, toggle on the field “First row is header”.

- Once you're done configuring the table and its annotation, click ‘save’ to view its extracted values.

- To view table extractions, you can view the extraction values directed on the document preview by checking the box called ‘view extractions as overlay’.

- You can click the ‘view’ button to view your extracted values as a table. Here you can also enable the ‘show crops’ toggle to view a cell by cell comparison of the document annotation crops and the extracted values.
