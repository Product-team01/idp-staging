## What is Vue MRKT?

**Vue MRKT** (Vue.ai’s Marketplace) is a one-stop shop—literally—for everything that the Vue Platform has to offer. The Vue MRKT delivers a combination of supercharged assets (recommended by Vue.ai Experts) and user-generated entities (models, datasets, workflows, etc.) that can be used within your organization and can also be made available to global users of the platform.

### What does Vue MRKT do?

- Enables you to publish any entity or feature built via Vue Platform (or anywhere else) as an asset to the marketplace.
- Empowers you to monetize your assets, models, and agents.
- Ensures that your IP remains yours.
- Encourages non-tech users to use assets, models, and agents for any business use case.

**Note:** Even though the asset is removed from the library, any entity created using the asset will remain available and functional.
