## Chart Selection Guide

The **Chart Selection Guide** provides insights into choosing the most suitable visualization types based on your data characteristics. It offers a concise reference for optimizing your visualizations in Metric Visualizer.

### Type of Visualizations

#### Charts
- **Bar Chart**: A versatile choice for comparing categories of data. Each category is represented by a rectangular bar proportional to its value, making it easy to see at a glance which category has the highest or lowest value. Bar charts are also effective for visualizing data that is not evenly distributed, as the bar lengths clearly depict the differences.
- **Line Chart**: A powerful tool for tracking trends and identifying patterns over time. Line charts connect data points with a line, allowing you to visualize how a metric has changed over a specific period. This makes it easy to see if a metric is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable. Line charts are particularly useful for visualizing continuous data, such as sales figures, website traffic, or stock prices.
- **Area Chart**: While line charts focus on the trend itself, area charts emphasize the magnitude of change over time. Area charts create a shaded area beneath the line, highlighting the overall volume or flow of a metric. This can be helpful for visualizing how much total value has been accumulated over time, such as total sales or website traffic.
- **Donut Chart**: An ideal choice for depicting proportions of a whole. Donut charts divide a circle into slices, where each slice represents the percentage that a specific category contributes to the total value. This makes it easy to see how the different parts relate to the whole and identify which category has the largest or smallest share.
- **Scatter Chart**: A valuable tool for revealing relationships between two numerical variables. Scatter charts plot individual data points on a graph with horizontal and vertical axes representing the two variables. By analyzing the position of the data points, you can identify correlations or clusters, which can suggest potential cause-and-effect relationships between the two variables.
- **Radar Chart**: A unique way to compare multiple metrics for a single data point. Radar charts use axes radiating from a center, with each axis representing a specific metric. The data point is then plotted on each axis, creating a visual representation of its performance across all metrics. This can be helpful for comparing the strengths and weaknesses of different options or evaluating an entity's performance on various criteria.
- **Tree Map**: A space-saving way to visualize hierarchical data structures. Tree Maps use nested squares to represent categories and subcategories. The size of each square corresponds to the value of the category it represents. This allows you to see the entire data structure at a glance and identify patterns or relationships between different categories.

#### Cards
- **Info Cards**: Info Cards provide quick summaries of crucial metrics, presented as compact data vignettes on your dashboard. Horizontal and vertical Info Cards offer instant insights, perfect for monitoring key data points without overwhelming details.

#### Tables
- **Tables**: Structured data grids offering a familiar and meticulous organization. Tables facilitate comprehensive analysis and comparison of individual data points, making them perfect for scenarios where precise values and granular details are crucial.
- **Pivot Tables**: Interactive tools that empower dynamic data manipulation. Effortlessly rearrange rows and columns to explore your data from multiple angles. Pivot tables are invaluable for uncovering hidden trends and patterns within even the most complex datasets.
