## What is a Node?

Simply put, Nodes are building blocks of workflows. Each node is designed to perform a particular function or task, such as data transformation, decision-making, or triggering an event. Nodes are connected in sequence to create a workflow, where the output of one node typically serves as the input to the next.

### What does a Node enable?

Nodes enable workflows. They are used in constructing workflows, which in turn helps solve a variety of use cases ranging from process automation, data processing, to API creation, and much more.

### What are the different types of Nodes?

- **Transform Nodes** - Details here
- **Compute Nodes** - TBD
- **Connectors Nodes** - TBD
- **HITL Nodes** - TBD
- **Model Nodes** - TBD
- **Dataset Nodes** - TBD
- **Custom Nodes** - Custom Code Nodes that serve any use case not solved by other node types. They allow users to extend the functionality of workflows via code tailored to specific needs.

#### Step 4: In the Schema section, either use the JSON editor or the chat widget to create the form UI by adding supported components. Supported Component list TBD

#### Step 5: In the JSON editor, link APIs to respective components as required.
